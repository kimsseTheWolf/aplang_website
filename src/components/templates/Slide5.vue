		<ul>
			<li>Find a healthy way to relieve your stresses: why not listen to music, exercise, play some video games, etc?</li>
			<li>Don't trust every information on social media, most of the time when reading them without distinguishing, they will mislead and create biases and potentially be dangerous for you.</li>
			<li>Join clubs, interest groups, or sports teams that build connections with others and also boost your confidence</li>
			<li>Although it sounds easy and not useful, keep practicing how to say "no" to others, including their gifts, drinks, or food.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>üö®This has already happened! What should I do?</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Don‚Äôt hide it‚Äîreach out to a school counselor, trusted adult, or helpline.</li>
			<li>Talk to a friend you trust who can support you without judgment.</li>
			<li>Set a small goal (like cutting the amount of consumption) and work from there.</li>
			<li>Learn about your options‚Äîusually, schools have support groups for students, and sometimes there are organizations in the community you can reach out to for help.</li>

		<h3>üí°How should I prevent my students from potential drug use?</h3>
		<p>Use the following strategies for prevention:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Build trust with your students. Let them be willing to communicate with you - either academic or daily life communication</li>
			<li>Encourage students to join school or class activities, let them build connections with other teachers and students at school.</li>
			<li>Be supportive. When your students are low or under stress, ask them if they need help, and provide any necessary support to them. This should be done privately, and each student should have different approaches and suggestions based on their situations.</li>
			<li>Teach your students how to distinguish drugs in daily life, where to ask for help, and how drugs will affect their mental and physical health.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>üö®This has already happened! What should I do?</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Speak to them privately, with concern, and do not blame: "Hey, I've noticed some changes. I care and I'm here."</li>
			<li>Contact parents and school administrators or other teachers who would help with this situation immediately.</li>
			<li>Follow up. Even just checking in can make a student feel seen.</li>
			<li>Keep things between you and the student. This should not let others be known otherwise it will create more pressures to the students and letting them become more confused during the process.</li>
