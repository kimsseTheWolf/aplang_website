                <li>Don't trust every information on social media, most of the time when reading them without distinguishment, they will mislead and create biases and potential dangerous for you.</li>
                <li>Join clubs, interests groups, or sports team that builds connections with others and also boost your confidence</li>
                <li>Although it sounds easy and not useful, but keep practicing how to say "no" to others, including their gifts, drinks, or food.</li>

              <ul>
                <li>Donâ€™t hide itâ€”reach out to a school counselor, trusted adult, or helpline.</li>
                <li>Talk to a friend you trust who can support you without judgment.</li>
                <li>Set a small goal (like cutting the amount of consuming) and work from there.</li>
                <li>Learn about your optionsâ€”usually schools have support groups for students, and somtimes there are organizations in the community you can reach out for help.</li>
